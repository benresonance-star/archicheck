# Victoria architectural checklist

Design-stage checklist for **houses**, **townhouses** and **apartments** in Victoria, Australia — pre-design through post-occupancy.

The first version is built around three deliverables:

1. A phone-and-desktop HTML interface, split by typology and by ARBV stage, with shadcn light/dark modes.
2. Lossless JSON import/export validated against the documented JSON Schema in `/schema`.
3. A downloadable ZIP: `manifest.json`, `project.json`, the exact `template.json` the project was filled against, and every attachment.

An HTML snapshot (date + revision in the header) is for reading without the app. It is not the lossless archive.

PDF and CSV are not in this version.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:43181](http://127.0.0.1:43181).

## Acceptance test

`npm test` creates a townhouse project, writes answers/notes/an attachment, exports a ZIP, wipes the data directory, imports the ZIP, and asserts every answer, note, attachment byte, and template association is restored.

In the UI: **Export ZIP** on a project, then **Import ZIP** on a fresh install (or another phone).

## Code scout

Each project has a **Code scout** screen. It fetches statewide Victorian / NCC pages plus that project’s municipality (from the site record). Alerts stay in the app. The first run stores a baseline; later runs (badge after seven days) compare hashes. You can tick flagged items yourself, or edit and accept proposed wording into a **draft template** — answers are never auto-changed.

This is a practice aid, not legal advice. Some official sites block automated fetch; those findings still list the URL and item ids.

## Grok Bots

Each stage has a named Grok Bot brief (copy the first task). Bots must not lodge permits or change the JSON except as a proposed patch.

Projects live **on the device** (IndexedDB JSON). The ZIP is the portable archive (manifest, project, template, attachments). Server files under `data/projects` are only used by the Node test harness.

To put this on the public internet: create a GitHub repo (Create repo in Cursor), then connect that repo to Vercel. Projects stay on each phone; Export ZIP to copy them.
